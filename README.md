🚗 Car-Price-Prediction-using-Gradient-Boosting-Regressor
📌 Project Overview

This project predicts the resale value of used cars using Machine Learning techniques. The goal is to help customers and dealerships make data-driven pricing decisions by analyzing car features such as mileage, fuel type, engine size, ownership, and more.

🎯 Objectives

Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand price trends.

Apply feature engineering & encoding for categorical data.

Build and train a Random Forest Regression model for price prediction.

Deploy a web application for real-time car price prediction.

🛠️ Technologies Used

Programming Language: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Machine Learning: Random Forest Regressor, Regression Analysis, Gradient Boosting Regressor

Deployment: Streamlit

Tools: Google colab , vscode

📊 Workflow

Data Collection & Cleaning – Handle missing values, duplicates, and outliers.

EDA – Visualize patterns and correlations in pricing factors.

Feature Engineering – Encode categorical variables, scale numerical features.

Model Training – Train using Random Forest Regressor and evaluate performance.

Deployment – Build a simple streamlit where users enter car details to get predictions.

📈 Results

Achieved an accurate model for predicting car prices.

Identified key factors influencing resale value (e.g., mileage, engine, location).

Delivered an interactive application for real-time predictions.
